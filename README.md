Project: Calculator App

Objective:
Create a web-based calculator application that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations using HTML, CSS, and Java.

Features:

- User-friendly interface with buttons for numbers, operators, and functions (e.g., sin, cos, tan)
- Display screen to show the input and output
- Ability to perform arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
- Ability to perform trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan)
- Ability to clear the input and output
- Responsive design for various screen sizes

Technologies:

- HTML: for structuring the content and creating the user interface
- CSS: for styling and layout
- Java: for creating the calculator logic and functionality using JavaScript

Requirements:

- Design and develop the calculator interface using HTML and CSS
- Implement the calculator logic using Java (JavaScript)
- Test and debug the application to ensure accuracy and functionality
- Deploy the application on a web server or platform (e.g., GitHub Pages)

Functional Requirements:

- The calculator should allow users to input numbers and operators using the buttons
- The calculator should display the input and output on the screen
- The calculator should perform arithmetic operations correctly
- The calculator should perform trigonometric functions correctly
- The calculator should clear the input and output when the clear button is pressed

Non-Functional Requirements:

- The application should be responsive and work on various devices and screen sizes
- The application should be user-friendly and easy to use
- The application should be efficient and fast in performing calculations

Deliverables:

- HTML file (index.html)
- CSS file (style.css)
- Java file (script.js)
- README file with instructions on how to run and test the application

Timeline:

- Design and development: 3 days
- Testing and debugging: 2 days
- Deployment: 1 day

Note: This project description is a basic outline and can be modified and expanded based on specific requirements and needs.
